## Overview

BeauKit is a luxury, AI-driven beauty intelligence application. The frontend delivers a dark editorial experience that allows users to upload or capture a photo, extract their skin's unique undertone via pixel-level color science, and instantly receive a full personalized beauty profile across six curated categories — all previewed live on a custom SVG avatar.

The application is a single-page React app built with a bespoke dark design system that blends editorial typography with glassmorphism, ambient lighting effects, and gold-accented UI components.

> **Note:** This repository covers the **frontend client only**. The backend REST API (Node/Express + database) lives in a separate `backend/` directory and must be running for analysis and authentication features to function.
---

## Features

### Authentication

- Sign up and sign in with JWT-based sessions
- Tokens persisted to `localStorage` for seamless page refreshes
- Protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users appropriately
- "Try without account" guest mode for instant analysis

### Skin Analysis Engine

- **File Upload** — drag-and-drop or click to upload any photo
- **Live Camera Capture** — real-time webcam feed with one-click photo capture
- **Pixel Sampling Algorithm** — samples the central 40% of the image frame, filters for true skin-range RGB values, and computes the average undertone
- Sends extracted `{ r, g, b }` values to the backend for AI classification

### Beauty Recommendations

Six personalized categories are generated per analysis:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| **Jewelry** | Best metals (gold/silver/rose gold), statement styles, and gemstones |
| **Clothing** | 16-color palette, 8 fashion styles, fabric and pattern guidance |
| **Lipstick** | 8 curated shades with finish type and occasion vibe |
| **Blush** | 6 matched shades with placement technique tips |
| **Eyeshadow** | Custom 8-pan palette built for your undertone and eye shape |
| **Hair Color** | 9 shades, styling directions, and salon treatment suggestions |

### Live SVG Avatar

- Fully programmatic SVG avatar rendered in React — no image assets required
- Reflects analysis results in real time: skin tone, hair color, outfit, lipstick, blush, eyeshadow, and jewelry
- Props-driven color system makes the avatar a true live preview tool

### Profile Management

- Save unlimited named beauty profiles to your account
- Load any saved profile to revisit or compare results
- Delete profiles you no longer need
- Each profile stores: skin tone data, all recommendations, and avatar capture

### Landing / Marketing Pages

- Hero section with animated avatar and stat counters
- Features grid with six benefit cards and staggered animation
- How It Works — three-step process breakdown
- Undertone Showcase — interactive Warm / Cool / Neutral comparison cards with swatches

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `>= 16.x`
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) `>= 8.x`
- The BeauKit backend server running on `http://localhost:5000`

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/beautykit.git
cd beautykit/frontend
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```sh
npm install
```

**3. Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` root:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

> By default, the app points to `http://localhost:5000`. Update this value to your deployed backend URL for staging or production builds.
**4. Start the development server**

```sh
npm start
```

The app will open automatically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Design System

BeauKit uses a comprehensive CSS custom property (variable) design system defined in `:root` inside `App.css`. All UI is built from these tokens — no third-party component library is used.

### Color Palette

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--obsidian` | `#06060e` | Page background |
| `--void` | `#09091a` | Deepest surfaces |
| `--depth` | `#0e0e20` | Section backgrounds |
| `--surface` | `#13132a` | Card backgrounds |
| `--surface2` | `#1a1a35` | Elevated surfaces |
| `--lift` | `#20203e` | Hover / active states |
| `--gold` | `#c4a84a` | Primary accent |
| `--gold-light` | `#e8cc80` | Gold highlights |
| `--rose` | `#c4728a` | Secondary accent |
| `--sage` | `#6a9e82` | Tertiary accent |
| `--violet` | `#7c5cbf` | Ambient orb tint |
| `--text` | `#f4efe8` | Primary text |
| `--text-muted` | `rgba(244,239,232,0.52)` | Subdued text |

### Typography

| Token | Font | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--serif` | Cormorant Garamond | Headlines, hero text, brand name |
| `--sans` | Outfit | Body copy, UI labels, buttons |

### Ambient Background

Three absolutely-positioned, heavily blurred radial gradient orbs float continuously via CSS keyframe animation, creating a dynamic ambient effect behind all content:

| Orb | Color | Position | Cycle |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orb 1 | Violet `rgba(124,92,191,0.22)` | Top-left | 28s |
| Orb 2 | Gold `rgba(196,168,74,0.14)` | Bottom-right | 22s (reversed) |
| Orb 3 | Rose `rgba(196,114,138,0.12)` | Center | 30s (delayed) |

### Component Tokens

| Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--r-xs` / `--r-sm` / `--r` / `--r-lg` / `--r-xl` | Border radius scale |
| `--shadow-sm` / `--shadow` / `--shadow-lg` | Elevation shadows |
| `--glow-gold` | Gold glow effect |
| `--border` | Subtle white border |
| `--border-glow` | Gold-tinted border |

---

## API Integration

All backend communication flows through a single `apiFetch` helper that automatically attaches the Bearer token from `localStorage`.

```
Base URL: http://localhost:5000  (or REACT_APP_API_URL)
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Auth Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/signup` | No | Register a new user |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/signin` | No | Sign in and receive JWT |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me` | Yes | Validate token and fetch user |
| `POST` | `/api/analyze-pixels` | Yes | Submit `{r, g, b}` — receive full recommendations |
| `GET` | `/api/profiles` | Yes | Fetch all saved profiles |
| `POST` | `/api/profiles` | Yes | Save a new beauty profile |
| `DELETE` | `/api/profiles/:id` | Yes | Delete a saved profile |

### Skin Pixel Extraction Algorithm

Before hitting the API, the frontend performs local image processing via the HTML5 Canvas API:

1. Draws the uploaded or captured image to an off-screen `<canvas>`
2. Samples every 3rd pixel in the **central 40% region** (x: 30–70%, y: 20–80%) to focus on facial skin
3. Filters pixels matching a skin-range heuristic: `r > 60 && g > 40 && b > 20 && r > g && r > b && (r - min(g,b)) > 10`
4. Falls back to a uniform average sample if fewer than 10 skin pixels are detected
5. Posts the computed `{ r, g, b }` average to the backend

This approach keeps heavy ML inference server-side while still sending meaningful, pre-processed color data.

## Application Pages

Page state is managed via a single `page` string in React state:

| State Value | Page | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `landing` | Landing / Marketing | Hero, features, how-it-works, undertone showcase |
| `auth` | Authentication | Sign in / sign up form with toggling modes |
| `scan` | Scanner | File upload or live camera capture UI |
| `analyzing` | Loading | Full-screen analysis animation |
| `results` | Results | Avatar preview and tabbed recommendations |
| `dashboard` | Dashboard | Saved profiles grid |

---

## Scripts

Run all commands from the `frontend/` directory:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | Start the development server at `localhost:3000` with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Create an optimized production build in the `build/` folder |

---

## Browser Support

| Environment | Targets |
|---|---|
| Production | `> 0.2%`, not dead, not op_mini |
| Development | Last 1 version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari |

> Camera capture requires **HTTPS** in production (or `localhost` in development) due to browser `getUserMedia` security constraints.
---

## Security Notes

- JWT tokens are stored in `localStorage`. For higher-security production deployments, consider migrating to `HttpOnly` cookies managed server-side.
- All `REACT_APP_*` variables are embedded into the client bundle at build time and are publicly visible — never store secrets in them.
- Camera permissions are requested only when the user explicitly switches to camera mode; no background access occurs.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Modularize `App.js` into a `/components` and `/pages` folder structure
- [ ] Add `REACT_APP_API_URL` env var support throughout (replace hardcoded `localhost:5000`)
- [ ] Implement React Router for deep-linkable pages
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for profile cards
- [ ] Introduce a theming toggle (Dark / Light editorial modes)
- [ ] Write unit tests with React Testing Library
- [ ] PWA support with offline caching of the last profile
